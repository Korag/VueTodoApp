# VueTodoApp

VueTodoApp is a project consisting of an API written in goLang and a client application based on the Vue.js framework. 

The implemented functionalities allow to create, list, edit and delete simple Todo elements representing tasks to be performed by the user.

The designed API uses GraphQL and was partially generated with gqlgen based on a predefined schema. The webservice stores the processed information in memory. A GraphQL Playground tool has been provided for convenient testing of the interface.

The Todo client application was written using the Vue.js framework and Vuetify, as well as Vue Apollo.
